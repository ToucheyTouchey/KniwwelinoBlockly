# Ardublockly
Ardublockly is a visual programming editor for Arduino. It is based on Google's [Blockly][1], which has been forked to generate [Arduino][15] code.

The `ArdublocklyServer` Python package initialises a local server to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE][2].

This is all packaged in a self contained executable desktop application for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

## Features
* Generates Arduino code with visual drag-and-drop blocks
* Uploads the code to an Arduino Board
* Useful "code block warnings"
* Compatible with a wide range of official Arduino Boards
* Works on Windows / Linux / Mac OS X

Ardublockly is still under development and a few features are not yet implemented. A to-do list can be found in the [TODO.md][3] file.

Currently tested under Windows with Python 2.7 and 3.4 and in Linux and MacOS X with Python 2.7.
